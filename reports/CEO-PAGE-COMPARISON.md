|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|-------|
| Risk of offending CEO | 5 (low) | 5 (low) | 3 (moderate) | C references FTX history and personal financials. Could feel invasive if tone is off. |

## VERDICT

**Option C wins decisively** in strategic impact (39/40) and interview utility (39/40). It ties Option A in design craft (40/40). Its only weakness is risk — the FTX history requires careful tone.

**Option A is the strongest pure design showcase** — the cascade animation alone proves more design capability than the other two combined. It's the safest choice if Jacob wants to avoid any risk.

**Option B is the most substantive reference document** — highest in content density (35/40) and lowest risk (all factual). But it scores lowest on design craft and memorability. It would make a great section WITHIN Option C rather than a standalone page.

### Recommendation: Build C, borrow the best of A

Build Option C as the primary page, but incorporate Option A's cascade animation as the visualization within C's "Product Stack" section (Section 4). This gives you:
- C's unforgettable three-number hero
- C's breadth (origin + market + regulation + products)
- A's cascade animation as the visual centerpiece when explaining Barrier Futures
- The closing design thesis that positions Jacob for the role

The FTX risk is manageable with the right tone. The framing is NOT "you came from FTX" — it IS "the most expensive lesson in fintech became the foundation for the most ambitious exchange." That's a founder's redemption story. Gruhn will recognize that Jacob sees the real narrative, not the tabloid version.
