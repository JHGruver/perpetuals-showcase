# CEO Page Concepts: 3 Options
## For the Patrick Gruhn / 3rd Round Interview
**Prepared by the team — February 2026**

---

## CONTEXT

**Who is Patrick Gruhn?**
Prof. Patrick Gruhn, LL.M., MBA — 44, German-born, serial entrepreneur, lawyer, software engineer. Co-CEO of Perpetuals.com (NASDAQ: PDC). First German Co-CEO of a NASDAQ tech company since BioNTech's Ugur Sahin.

**His career arc:**
- Founded MagicalWorks at 18 (21x award-winning hosting company)
- Acquired and turned around K-TV (largest German-speaking Catholic TV network)
- Co-founded DigitalAssets.AG in Zurich — acquired by FTX for ~$376M
- Became Head of FTX Europe — pioneered the world's first regulatory-approved tokenized stocks
- After FTX collapsed, bought back FTX EU assets for $32.7M through court-approved settlement
- Founded Perpetuals.com — now NASDAQ-listed, launching Barrier Futures March 2026
- MIT blockchain certificate, Harvard/Yale contract law, currently pursuing PhD in Management
- Professor of Practice (Entrepreneurship, Digital Innovation & Ethics)

**What he cares about:** Regulatory architecture as competitive moat. Building institutions, not just products. Legitimacy in a space full of fraud. He's a lawyer who builds technology — he thinks in frameworks, compliance, and long-term positioning.

**What he'll evaluate Jacob on:** Can this person think at CEO-level about the business? Does he understand why this company exists — not just what it looks like? Is he someone I want in the room when we're making strategic decisions?

## OPTION A: "The $150 Billion Problem"

### Concept
A single-narrative page built around one devastating statistic: **$150 billion in forced liquidations** happened in crypto derivatives in 2025 alone. That's not a market inefficiency — that's a design failure. And Barrier Futures is the answer.

### Structure
The page tells one story in five acts:

**Act 1 — The Number**
Full-viewport hero. Just the number: `$150,000,000,000`. Subtitle: "Forced liquidations in crypto derivatives. 2025 alone." Scroll to continue.

**Act 2 — How Liquidation Cascades Work**
Animated visualization showing a cascade: one leveraged position gets liquidated, pushes price down, triggers the next liquidation, chain reaction. Real examples — the $2.2B liquidation event of [specific date]. Show the mechanics visually: margin call > forced close > price impact > next margin call > crash.

**Act 3 — Who Gets Hurt**
Three columns: Retail traders (74-89% lose money per ESMA data, 19M CFD traders globally). Exchanges (reputation damage, regulatory scrutiny, lost users). Regulators (ESMA leverage restrictions, MiCA enforcement July 2026, increasing intervention). Everyone loses.

**Act 4 — The Barrier Futures Solution**
Visual comparison: traditional perpetual swap (cascading liquidation animation) vs. Barrier Future (defined-risk, stop-loss barrier embedded at entry). No margin calls. No funding fees. No cascades. The position simply closes at the barrier. Show the math: same trade, same market move — one triggers a cascade, the other doesn't.

**Act 5 — The Market Opportunity**
The numbers that make this a $trillion opportunity:
- $85.7T crypto derivatives volume (2025)
- $846T global OTC derivatives (BIS)
- 74-89% retail loss rate driving regulatory action
- BayesShield AI: 92% losing trade filter rate (11.7B trades trained)
- EU T+1 deadline: Oct 2027 (Perpetuals already at T+0)
- MiCA full enforcement: July 2026 (Perpetuals already MiFID II compliant)

Close with: "Barrier Futures don't just solve a trading problem. They solve a regulatory problem. That's why this isn't a feature — it's a moat."

### Why This Works for Gruhn
- Centers his core product innovation — Barrier Futures is HIS thesis
- Uses real data ($150B, 92% BayesShield, ESMA stats) — not hand-wavy
- Tells a story a lawyer-CEO understands: problem > harm > solution > market
- Shows Jacob understands the BUSINESS, not just the UI
- The cascade visualization is exactly the kind of design challenge Jacob would own

### Visual Style
Dark theme. Scroll-driven storytelling. Minimal text, maximum data visualization. The cascade animation is the centerpiece — it should be mesmerizing and slightly terrifying. Think: a Bloomberg terminal had a baby with a long-form NYT visual essay.

### Risk
Heavy on product strategy, lighter on design craft. Gruhn might think "great analyst" instead of "great designer." Mitigate by making the visualizations themselves the proof of design capability.

## OPTION B: "The Regulatory Chessboard"

### Concept
An interactive regulatory landscape map showing why Perpetuals.com's licensing and compliance positioning is a multi-year competitive moat — not just a checkbox. Visualize the global regulatory chess game and show where Perpetuals.com has pieces that competitors don't.

### Structure

**Hero: The Chessboard**
A stylized grid/map visualization. Rows = jurisdictions (EU, US, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia). Columns = license types (MTF, CASP/MiCA, Securities, Derivatives, Custody). Each cell is either filled (has license), pending, or empty. Perpetuals.com's cells glow orange. Competitors' cells are gray. The visual instantly shows: Perpetuals has pieces in positions others don't.

**Section 1 — The Regulatory Stack**
Interactive timeline showing the regulatory tsunami hitting crypto:
- MiCA full enforcement: July 1, 2026
- DORA effective: Jan 17, 2025
- EMIR 3.0: Dec 24, 2024 (phased through 2026)
- EU T+1 mandate: Oct 11, 2027
- ESMA CFD restrictions: ongoing
Each event is a card with hover-reveal showing what it means for the business. The key insight: **every regulation is a moat for compliant companies and a wall for non-compliant ones.**

**Section 2 — License Deep Dive**
Perpetuals.com's CySEC MTF license (#458/25) visualized as a node map showing what it unlocks:
- MiFID II passporting across 30 EEA countries
- Recognized equivalence in US, Australia, Hong Kong
- Ability to list crypto derivatives AS financial instruments (not as crypto-assets under MiCA)
- Self-clearing capability (no third-party CCP dependency)
Show this as an expanding network — one license, 30+ jurisdictions.

**Section 3 — The Competitive Moat**
Side-by-side comparison matrix:
| Capability | Perpetuals | Backpack EU | Kraken | Crypto.com | Binance |
Rows: MTF license, Self-clearing, Barrier Futures, AI risk mgmt, Quantum-resilient custody, T+0 settlement, MiFID II, MiCA, DORA compliant.
The visual punch: Perpetuals has the most filled cells. Backpack EU is closest competitor (same FTX EU lineage). Binance has almost nothing in regulated space.

**Section 4 — What This Means for Design**
Bridge to Jacob's role: "Regulatory complexity is a design problem. Every compliance requirement is a UX decision. MiFID II best execution disclosures, MiCA risk warnings, DORA operational resilience reporting — these aren't legal footnotes. They're interface elements that either build trust or destroy it. This is the design challenge I want."

### Why This Works for Gruhn
- Speaks directly to his identity: lawyer, regulatory strategist, institution-builder
- Shows Jacob understands that the LICENSE is the product (not just the software)
- The competitive matrix validates Gruhn's strategic positioning
- The "regulatory complexity is a design problem" bridge is exactly how a CDO should think
- Demonstrates research depth that goes far beyond surface-level

### Visual Style
Light theme with dark data panels. Think: McKinsey strategy deck meets interactive web experience. Clean, authoritative, data-dense. The chessboard visualization is the hero — it should feel like a war room strategic map.

### Risk
Could feel too "consultant-y" and not enough "designer." Mitigate with beautiful data visualization craft — the HOW it's presented IS the design proof.

## OPTION C: "From $376M to $32.7M to NASDAQ"

### Concept
A narrative-driven experience that traces the Perpetuals.com origin story through the lens of the market data that makes it inevitable. Not a company history — a THESIS for why this company exists NOW, told through the numbers that prove the opportunity is real and the timing is right.

### Structure

**Hero: The Three Numbers**
Dramatic entrance: three numbers fade in sequentially.
`$376M` — what FTX paid for DigitalAssets.AG
`$32.7M` — what Gruhn paid to buy it back
`$846T` — the market they're going after
Subtitle: "The most expensive lesson in fintech became the foundation for the most ambitious."

**Section 1 — The Market Nobody Owns**
Animated data visualization showing the $846T OTC derivatives market breakdown:
- Interest rate derivatives: $548T
- FX derivatives: $155T (up 19% YoY — fastest growth since 2008)
- Credit derivatives: fastest growing at 23% YoY
- Crypto derivatives: $85.7T annual volume
Scroll-driven: as user scrolls, the visualization builds layer by layer. End state: a towering bar chart that makes traditional markets look enormous and crypto look like a sliver — the growth sliver.

**Section 2 — The Institutional Shift**
Key metrics visualized as an adoption curve:
- BlackRock IBIT: $54B AUM, $25B inflows in 2025 despite -9.6% return
- Total US BTC ETF AUM: $114-137B
- CME crypto futures: record 794,903 contracts/day (132% YoY growth)
- DTCC tokenizing US Treasuries (SEC no-action letter Dec 2025)
- CFTC permitting tokenized assets as derivatives collateral
The narrative: institutional money isn't coming — it arrived. The infrastructure to serve it hasn't caught up.

**Section 3 — The Compliance Countdown**
Interactive timeline visualization counting down to key regulatory deadlines:
- MiCA full enforcement: July 1, 2026 (months away)
- EMIR 3.0 Active Account Requirement: June 25, 2026
- EU T+1 settlement mandate: October 11, 2027
Each deadline is a pressure point. Non-compliant platforms face shutdown. Compliant platforms inherit their market share. Show the funnel: 100+ crypto exchanges today > after MiCA enforcement > after DORA audits > after T+1 mandate. The number of survivors shrinks at each gate. Perpetuals.com passes through every one.

**Section 4 — The Product Stack**
Visual architecture diagram of everything Perpetuals.com is building:
- Kronos X (exchange engine) at center
- Barrier Futures (no-liquidation derivatives) — $150B problem solved
- BayesShield AI (92% losing trade filter) — NVIDIA-powered
- Perpetuals Vault (quantum-resilient custody) — no third-party dependency
- Ledgera (meta-blockchain settlement) — T+0 cross-chain
- PerpetualPay (payments)
Each node is interactive with depth on hover. The visual story: this isn't one product — it's a vertically integrated financial infrastructure stack.

**Section 5 — Why Design Matters Here**
Close with the design thesis: "Every piece of this stack has a user. Brokers onboarding to Barrier Futures. Traders managing risk with BayesShield. Institutional clients trusting Perpetuals Vault with their assets. The technology is world-class. The regulatory positioning is years ahead. The missing piece is making it feel as trustworthy as it actually is. That's the design problem I want to solve."

### Why This Works for Gruhn
- Opens with HIS story ($376M > $32.7M) — immediately personal
- Shows Jacob understands the full arc: FTX lesson, buyback, rebrand, NASDAQ listing
- The market data is CEO-level: $846T, institutional adoption, regulatory deadlines
- Product stack visualization shows Jacob understands the entire business, not one feature
- The closing thesis positions design as the accelerator for everything Gruhn has built
- Numbers are specific, sourced, and impressive — this is someone who did real diligence

### Visual Style
Dark, immersive, scroll-driven narrative. Large typography for key numbers. Data visualizations that build as you scroll. Think: a pitch deck that became an experience. The three hero numbers should feel like a movie title sequence. Premium, confident, editorial.

### Risk
The FTX connection is sensitive. Framing matters enormously. This is NOT "you came from FTX." It IS "you saw the failure up close, bought back the pieces, and built something better." If the tone is wrong, it backfires. If the tone is right, it shows Jacob understands the real story and isn't afraid of it.

## RECOMMENDATION

**For maximum impact with a lawyer-CEO serial entrepreneur:** Option C.

It's the most personal, the most narrative-driven, and the hardest to build — which means it shows the most craft. The three-number hero is unforgettable. The market data is CEO-level. And the closing thesis ("the missing piece is making it feel as trustworthy as it actually is") is the exact sentence that gets Jacob hired.

**If Jacob wants to play it safer:** Option A. The $150B problem is universally compelling and centers the core product without touching the FTX history.

**If Jacob wants to speak Gruhn's strategic language:** Option B. The regulatory chessboard is how Gruhn thinks. But it's the driest option visually.
