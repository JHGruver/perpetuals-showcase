# Interview Prep: 2nd Round with Aaron Rudder, CPO
## Perpetuals.com — Jacob H. Gruver — February 2026

---

## FOR THE PRACTICE PARTNER

You're playing **Aaron Rudder**, CPO of Perpetuals.com. Aaron has a finance, economics, and consulting background (Deloitte). He thinks in business outcomes and market strategy — not design details.

**How to use this document:**
1. Read the "About Aaron" section so you know how he thinks
2. Use the **Question Bank** to ask Jacob questions in order (or skip around)
3. After Jacob does his ~2-minute showcase, push back — use the "Pushback Scenarios" section
4. Score Jacob on: confidence, specificity, not rambling, asking good questions back
5. The interview should run 25-30 minutes total

**What "good" looks like from Jacob:**
- Connects every design answer to a business outcome
- Mentions specific companies, numbers, and regulated industries — not generalities
- Keeps the showcase under 2 minutes and transitions to conversation
- Asks Aaron real questions, not softball ones
- Answers the "why are you leaving CDO" question in under 40 seconds without badmouthing anyone

---

## ABOUT AARON RUDDER (for context)

**Background:** Finance, economics, consulting. University of Oregon. Deloitte Consulting. Currently CPO at Perpetuals.com and associated with a stealth startup.

**He thinks in:** Business outcomes, market positioning, strategic leverage. Not pixels. When Jacob talks design, he should frame it as a business decision.

**His likely concerns about Jacob:**
1. Why is a CDO/Co-Founder applying here? Running from something?
2. Can this person execute, or just lead from a whiteboard?
3. Will he fit into the team, or try to own everything?
4. Does he actually understand fintech and crypto, or is he faking depth?

---

## THE SHOWCASE (2 MINUTES MAX)

### Strategy

**10 minutes showing websites = "impressive designer"**
**2 minutes showing insights + 8 minutes in conversation = "product leader I need to hire"**

Aaron doesn't need to see CSS animations. He needs to see how Jacob thinks. The sites are PROOF, not the presentation. Jacob is the presentation.

---

### The Flow

#### 0:00 — Setup (15 seconds)
**On screen:** Nothing. Eye contact.

> "Before we dig in, I want to show you something quick. I got excited about Perpetuals and couldn't stop at just preparing talking points — I did a full competitive teardown and built some prototypes. I'll keep this to 2 minutes because I'd rather spend our time in conversation."

---

#### 0:15 — The Analysis Dashboard (75 seconds)
**On screen:** Competitive Analysis page — dashboard only. DO NOT SCROLL.

Open the Analysis page. Let the dashboard speak. Point to 3 things:

**1. The positioning map (15 sec):**
> "I analyzed 9 platforms across consumer, professional, and crypto. The positioning map tells the story — there's an open quadrant where no one sits. Institutional depth with consumer clarity. That's where I see Perpetuals."

**2. The 57% stat (15 sec):**
> "This one surprised me — 57% of financial services companies faced accessibility litigation last year. That's not a design nice-to-have, that's a business risk. WCAG AA compliance should be in the foundation, not bolted on."

**3. The friction insight (30 sec — THE MONEY MOMENT):**
> "The biggest insight from the research: friction is a design tool, not a bug. Every consumer app is racing to zero friction. But in professional trading, you NEED friction — for trust, for compliance, for preventing a $2M fat-finger error at 3am. The design challenge at Perpetuals isn't removing friction, it's being intentional about WHERE you put it. That's the kind of problem I want to solve."

Then close the tab or minimize.

---

#### 1:30 — Bridge to Conversation (30 seconds)
**On screen:** Nothing. Close the laptop or go back to portal.

> "I built more — a homepage redesign, features page, product vision, design system — but I'd rather talk about what I found than walk through more pages. The work is there if you want to look later."

Then ask a QUESTION (this flips from presenter to peer):

**Option A — If Aaron seems impressed:**
> "The competitive research pointed to friction design as the core UX challenge. How does the team think about that today? Is there a framework, or is it more case-by-case?"

**Option B — If Aaron seems cautious:**
> "I'm curious — where does Perpetuals sit on the simplicity-to-complexity spectrum right now? Is the team optimizing for onboarding new users or empowering power users?"

**Option C — If Aaron seems skeptical:**
> "I learn best by making things. What did I get wrong in the research? I'd genuinely love to know."

---

### THAT'S IT. 2 MINUTES. DONE.

The remaining time should be CONVERSATION.

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO DURING THE SHOWCASE

- DO NOT scroll through pages explaining sections
- DO NOT show the homepage, features, or vision pages (Aaron can see those on his own time)
- DO NOT read text off the screen — dashboards are visual proof, not a script
- DO NOT spend time on animations, transitions, or design details
- DO NOT say "I built this from scratch" — sounds like fishing for praise
- DO NOT apologize for the work — own it

---

## QUESTION BANK

*Practice partner: ask these in order, or skip around based on the conversation. Push for specifics if Jacob gives vague answers.*

---

### OPENER

**"Tell me about yourself."**

*Jacob should keep this to 90 seconds. Career arc, not resume recitation.*

> "I'm a design leader with 11 years across some of the most regulated industries in tech — automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and financial services. I've been CDO and Co-Founder at 42robotsAI for the past two years, building AI products from scratch in healthcare and knowledge management. Before that, I led design at TCS for Boeing, Cisco, and Invisalign — global engineering teams, enterprise design systems, compliance constraints. I got my start at CloudCar doing infotainment UX for Jaguar Land Rover — that work shipped in 30 million vehicles. The common thread is complex, high-stakes products where the design decisions have real consequences — which is exactly why Perpetuals caught my attention."

---

### THE BIG ONE

**"Why are you leaving your CDO / Co-Founder role?"**

*This is THE question. If Jacob fumbles it, nothing else matters. Should be under 40 seconds.*

> "I co-founded 42robotsAI and built the design function from nothing — Atticus in healthcare AI, HK3K in knowledge management, our entire design system. I'm proud of what we built. But what I want next is to apply that kind of leadership at a company with a bigger playing field and a harder problem. Perpetuals is operating in a space I care about — regulated financial infrastructure where the UX decisions have real consequences. An $846 trillion derivatives market, blockchain settlement, regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions — that's a design problem worth committing to. I'm not leaving because something failed. I'm leaving because I want to build at a scale and complexity that a startup can't offer yet."

*Red flags if Jacob: badmouths co-founders, says "it was time for a change," or takes longer than 40 seconds.*

---

### ABOUT FIT

**"Why Perpetuals? Why not stay and grow your own company?"**

> "Three reasons. First, the problem — you're building regulated exchange infrastructure at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto. That's not a UI problem, it's an architecture problem. Progressive disclosure, trust calibration, compliance-as-UX — those are design challenges that get me out of bed. Second, the timing — you just rebranded, you're launching new product lines, the design decisions being made right now will define the platform for years. I want to be making those decisions, not inheriting them. Third — I've built from zero twice now. What I want is to build at scale, with real market pressure. My startup gave me breadth. Perpetuals would give me depth."

---

**"What's your experience with financial services?"**

> "More than most candidates will have. Through Compassionate Design, I've worked with Merrill Lynch and Charles Schwab on UX — trust flows, portfolio dashboards, reducing login friction. At Phygtl, I was Head of Design for a Web3 education platform, so I understand blockchain UX patterns, wallet flows, and the onboarding gap between crypto-native and crypto-curious users. And the competitive analysis I built for this interview covers 9 trading platforms in depth — Robinhood, Fidelity, Schwab, Bloomberg, Coinbase, Interactive Brokers, thinkorswim, E*Trade, and Kraken. I'm not coming in cold."

---

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**

> "I'm a can-of-worms person. I open one problem and find three more inside it, and I want to chase all of them. At 42robotsAI, I was redesigning the onboarding flow for Atticus and started pulling on edge cases — what happens if a clinician has two roles, what if their license is pending, what about partial data imports. Each question was valid, but I was three layers deep into problems we didn't need to solve yet. The feature that mattered — getting a clinician from signup to first patient dashboard in under five minutes — sat untouched while I mapped every edge case in the system. I've learned to set a boundary: solve the problem in front of you, document the cans of worms, and come back to them when they're the actual priority. My curiosity is an asset, but I have to manage it or it eats the timeline."

---

### DESIGN LEADERSHIP

**"How do you think about building a design team and function?"**

> "I've done it three times — at 42robotsAI from zero, at Phygtl, and I helped establish design system standards at TCS for the Boeing and Invisalign programs. My approach: start with principles, not headcount. Define what 'good design' means at this company — for Perpetuals, that's probably trust, clarity, and speed. Then build the system that enforces those principles — component library, design tokens, interaction patterns, documentation. The system does the heavy lifting so individual designers can focus on solving novel problems instead of reinventing buttons. I also believe in embedding designers with engineering pods, not siloing them."

---

**"Walk me through how you'd approach a complex product you don't fully understand yet."**

> "I did this at CloudCar — I came in knowing nothing about automotive infotainment, NHTSA distraction guidelines, or in-vehicle HMI constraints. I spent the first two weeks learning the domain: reading safety standards, sitting with engineers, studying competitor systems in actual vehicles. By week three I was designing with confidence because I understood the 'why' behind every constraint. I did the same at TCS with Boeing — ITAR-regulated aerospace is not intuitive. For Perpetuals, I'd invest real time understanding MiFID II compliance requirements, order types, settlement flows, and margin mechanics before I touched a wireframe. The competitive analysis I built is step one of that process."

---

**"How do you handle disagreements with product or engineering?"**

> "With evidence. At 42robotsAI, my co-founders had strong and often conflicting product opinions. I learned quickly that design arguments based on taste lose every time. Arguments based on user behavior, competitive data, or a prototype that proves the point — those win. I've also learned that early engineering involvement prevents most disagreements. When engineers are in the design review from day one, the 'that's not buildable' conversation happens at sketch stage, not handoff."

---

**"Tell me about a design system you've built."**

> "The most impactful was at 42robotsAI — I built it from scratch for a product suite that included a healthcare AI dashboard, a knowledge management tool, and client-facing white-label deployments. Atomic design structure: tokens, primitives, components, patterns. The payoff came when we needed to spin up a white-label version for an enterprise client — what would have been weeks of design work took days because the system was there. Before that, at TCS, I established component library standards for Boeing that reduced design iteration cycles by 20%."

---

### PRODUCT THINKING

**"If I handed you the Perpetuals trading interface and said 'make it better,' where would you start?"**

> "I wouldn't start designing. I'd start by watching real users — both retail and institutional — try to complete a trade. Where do they hesitate? Where do they call support? Where do they abandon? Then I'd look at the data: drop-off points in the order flow, error rates on order entry, support ticket clusters. And I'd want to understand the business priority: are we optimizing for trade volume, onboarding conversion, reducing support load, or regulatory audit readiness? The design solution depends on which problem we're solving."

---

**"How do you design for trust in financial products?"**

> "Trust comes from three layers: transparency, consistency, and appropriate friction. Users need to know exactly what's happening with their money at all times — no ambiguity in order status, no hidden fees, no mystery states. The interface needs to be predictable enough that users build muscle memory. And you need intentional friction — confirmation dialogs, two-factor flows, risk warnings — because the cost of a mistake is real money. I'd also surface compliance as a trust signal, not hide it. If the platform is MiFID II licensed and CySEC regulated, that should be visible, not buried in a footer."

---

**"What's the biggest UX challenge in crypto/fintech right now?"**

> "Bridging the gap between crypto-native and crypto-curious users without alienating either. Most crypto products are built by engineers for engineers — they assume familiarity with gas fees, slippage, order types, wallet management. The platforms that win will create graduated complexity: simple enough for a first-time user, powerful enough for a professional managing a derivatives portfolio. Perpetuals is in an interesting position because Barrier Futures — eliminating liquidation cascades — is itself a product simplification. The UX should match that philosophy."

---

**"How do you prioritize when you have five features and bandwidth for two?"**

> "Three filters: impact on the metric that matters most right now, what's blocked by engineering timelines, and what serves the widest user base. But the harder part is saying no to stakeholders who are emotionally invested. That's where having agreed-upon design principles saves you. At 42robotsAI, I built a scoring rubric that product, design, and engineering all used — it didn't eliminate debate, but it moved the debate from 'I feel' to 'the framework says.'"

---

### ABOUT THE SHOWCASE

**"Tell me about the competitive analysis you built."**

> "I analyzed 9 platforms across consumer, professional, and crypto — Robinhood, Fidelity, Schwab, Bloomberg Terminal, Coinbase, Interactive Brokers, thinkorswim, E*Trade, and Kraken. The most valuable output was the positioning map: there's a clear gap where institutional-depth tools meet consumer-grade clarity. Bloomberg owns the top-right — complex and institutional. Robinhood owns the bottom-left — simple and retail. Nobody owns the bottom-right. That's where I see Perpetuals. The most surprising finding was the accessibility data: 57% of financial services firms faced litigation last year."

---

**"Did you use AI to build these?"**

> "Yes, as a tool — the same way I use Figma or a spreadsheet. The research, the competitive analysis framework, the product thinking, the design decisions — those are mine. I chose what to analyze, what to prioritize, and what story to tell. AI helped me execute faster. I expect every design team at Perpetuals is using AI tools to ship faster. The question isn't whether you use AI, it's whether you have the judgment to direct it."

---

## PUSHBACK SCENARIOS

*Practice partner: use these to test Jacob under pressure.*

---

**"This is impressive but we need a product leader, not a designer."**

> "Totally agree. The build was how I processed the research — I think by making things. But the takeaway isn't the websites, it's the insights: friction design, accessibility risk, and market positioning. Those are the product conversations I want to have every day."

---

**"These metrics aren't accurate to our actual plans."**

> "I'd be surprised if they were — I built this from the outside looking in. That's actually what excites me about this role: I want to learn what the real picture looks like and apply this kind of strategic thinking to actual constraints."

---

**"You seem overqualified. A CDO joining as what — a senior designer?"**

> "I'm not optimizing for title. I'm optimizing for the problem. I've been a CDO at a 10-person startup. That taught me everything about building from zero. What it didn't teach me is building at scale with real regulatory pressure, institutional clients, and a $846 trillion market. That's what I want to learn. And I'd rather be hands-on at a company doing something hard than managing from a distance at a company doing something easy."

---

**"What if we're not where you think we are? What if the product is earlier than you expect?"**

> "Even better. Early-stage product decisions are the ones that compound. Getting the design system, the trust framework, and the compliance UX patterns right now means not having to untangle them later. That's exactly the work I did at 42robotsAI and CloudCar — zero to one."

---

**"How do we know you won't leave in a year to start another company?"**

> "I've done the founder thing. I know what it costs and what it gives you. What it doesn't give you is the chance to work on a problem this complex with this kind of infrastructure behind it. I'm looking for the opposite of a startup — I want institutional-scale problems, a team to build with, and a platform that millions of people will use. That's not a one-year commitment."

---

## QUESTIONS JACOB SHOULD ASK AARON

*Pick 2-3. Match the energy of the conversation.*

**"What does the product and design team look like today, and where are the biggest gaps?"**
Shows you're thinking about where you fit. Gets Aaron to tell you exactly what he needs.

**"How does the team currently navigate the tension between regulatory compliance and user experience?"**
THE question for a fintech product leader. Signals you already understand their core constraint.

**"What's the hardest product decision you've had to make since the rebrand?"**
Flips the dynamic. CPOs rarely get asked about their own challenges. Reveals real problems.

**"What would a successful first 90 days look like for whoever takes this role?"**
Practical and forward-looking. Shows you're already thinking about execution.

**"Kronos X serves institutional MTFs and eventually retail users. How do you think about designing one platform that serves both?"**
Product architecture disguised as a UX question. Shows you understand their fundamental tension.

**DO NOT ASK:** Salary/benefits in a 2nd round. "What does your company do?" Anything you could answer from their website.

---

## IF AARON ASKS TO SEE MORE

Let HIM drive:

> "Absolutely — what would be most useful? I have the competitive analysis with platform-by-platform breakdowns, a product vision with a speculative roadmap, a full design system, or the homepage and features prototypes."

Let him pick. Show what he asks for. Stop when he stops asking.

---

## THE ONE LINE TO REMEMBER

If you forget everything else:

> **"Friction is a design tool, not a bug. The challenge at Perpetuals isn't removing friction — it's being intentional about where you put it."**

That one sentence shows more product thinking than 10 minutes of demos.
