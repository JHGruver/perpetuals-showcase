# Interview Playbook: 2nd Round with Aaron Rudder, CPO
## Total showcase time: 3 minutes. Not 10. Here's why.

---

## THE STRATEGY

**10 minutes showing websites = "impressive designer"**
**3 minutes showing insights + 7 minutes in conversation = "product leader I need to hire"**

Aaron doesn't need to see your CSS animations. He needs to see how you think.
The sites exist as PROOF, not as the presentation. You're the presentation.

---

## THE 3-MINUTE FLOW

### Minute 0:00 - The Setup (15 seconds)
**What's on screen:** Nothing yet. Eye contact.

**Say this:**
> "Before we dig in, I want to show you something quick. I got excited about Perpetuals and couldn't stop at just preparing talking points — I did a full competitive teardown and built some prototypes. I'll keep this to 3 minutes because I'd rather spend our time in conversation."

**Why this works:** You're signaling that you're a builder AND that you respect his time. The "I got excited" framing is authentic, not performative.

---

### Minute 0:15 - The Analysis Dashboard (60 seconds)
**What's on screen:** Competitive Analysis page — dashboard only. DO NOT SCROLL.

**Open the Analysis page. Let the dashboard speak. Point to 3 things:**

1. **The positioning map** (15 sec):
> "I analyzed 9 platforms across consumer, professional, and crypto. The positioning map tells the story — there's an open quadrant where no one sits. Institutional depth with consumer clarity. That's where I see Perpetuals."

2. **The 57% stat** (15 sec):
> "This one surprised me — 57% of financial services companies faced accessibility litigation last year. That's not a design nice-to-have, that's a business risk. WCAG AA compliance should be in the foundation, not bolted on."

3. **The friction insight** (30 sec — THIS IS YOUR MONEY MOMENT):
> "The biggest insight from the research: friction is a design tool, not a bug. Every consumer app is racing to zero friction. But in professional trading, you NEED friction — for trust, for compliance, for preventing a $2M fat-finger error at 3am. The design challenge at Perpetuals isn't removing friction, it's being intentional about WHERE you put it. That's the kind of problem I want to solve."

**Then close the laptop / minimize the tab.**

---

### Minute 1:15 - The Vision Dashboard (45 seconds)
**What's on screen:** Product Vision page — dashboard only. DO NOT SCROLL.

**Say this:**
> "I also did a speculative vision exercise — not to presume what your roadmap actually looks like, but to show how I think about long-term product strategy."

**Point to the roadmap:**
> "The framework I used: start with the foundation you're building now, identify when each capability layer needs to land, and work backwards from a 2030 north star. The four pillars — Radical Simplicity, Institutional Trust, Infinite Scale, Open Ecosystem — those came out of the competitive research. Every feature decision should map back to one of them."

**KEY FRAMING — say this explicitly:**
> "Obviously these are hypothetical milestones. I'd want to learn where you actually are and what the real constraints look like. But this is how I structure product thinking — measurable pillars, time-boxed phases, and a north star that doesn't move."

**Then close it.**

---

### Minute 2:00 - The Bridge to Conversation (60 seconds)
**What's on screen:** Nothing. Close the laptop or go back to the portal page.

**Say this:**
> "I built a few more things — a homepage redesign, a features page, a full design system — but I'd rather talk about what I found in the research than walk you through more pages. The work is there if you want to look at it later."

**Then ask a QUESTION (this is how you flip from presenter to peer):**

Pick ONE of these based on the conversation energy:

**Option A — If Aaron seems impressed:**
> "The competitive research pointed to friction design as the core UX challenge. How does the team think about that today? Is there a framework, or is it more case-by-case?"

**Option B — If Aaron seems cautious:**
> "I'm curious about something — where does Perpetuals sit on the simplicity-to-complexity spectrum right now? Is the team optimizing for onboarding new users or empowering power users?"

**Option C — If Aaron seems skeptical:**
> "I know building speculative vision work can be presumptuous. But I learn best by making things. What did I get wrong? I'd genuinely love to know."

---

## THAT'S IT. 3 MINUTES. DONE.

The remaining 7+ minutes should be CONVERSATION about:
- His actual challenges (ask, don't assume)
- Your approach to product leadership (tell stories from past roles)
- How you'd ramp up (show humility, show curiosity)

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- DO NOT scroll through the pages explaining sections
- DO NOT show the homepage or features page (they prove execution, but Aaron can see that on his own time)
- DO NOT read text off the screen — the dashboards are there for visual proof, not for narration
- DO NOT spend time on animations, transitions, or design details
- DO NOT say "I built this from scratch" — it sounds like you're looking for praise
- DO NOT apologize for the work — own it confidently

---

## IF AARON ASKS TO SEE MORE

Great. That means he's interested. But let HIM drive:

> "Absolutely — what would be most useful? I have the competitive analysis with platform-by-platform breakdowns, a full design system with component documentation, or the homepage/features prototypes."

Let him pick. Show what he asks for. Stop when he stops asking.

---

## IF AARON PUSHES BACK

**"This is impressive but we need a product leader, not a designer"**
> "Totally agree. The build was how I processed the research — I think by making things. But the takeaway isn't the websites, it's the insights: friction design, accessibility risk, and market positioning. Those are the product conversations I want to have every day."

**"These metrics/vision aren't accurate to our actual plans"**
> "I'd be surprised if they were — I built this from the outside looking in. That's actually what excites me about this role: I want to learn what the real picture looks like and apply this kind of strategic thinking to actual constraints."

**"Did you use AI to build these?"**
> "I used AI as a tool, the same way I'd use Figma or a spreadsheet. The research, the insights, the product thinking — that's mine. I chose what to analyze, what to prioritize, and what story to tell. AI helped me build faster, but it didn't tell me that friction is a design tool or that 57% of fintech companies face accessibility litigation."

---

## THE ONE LINE TO REMEMBER

If you forget everything else, say this:

> **"Friction is a design tool, not a bug. The challenge at Perpetuals isn't removing friction — it's being intentional about where you put it."**

That one sentence shows more product thinking than 10 minutes of demos ever could.

## PRE-INTERVIEW CHECKLIST

- [ ] Have the Analysis page open in a browser tab (dashboard visible)
- [ ] Have the Vision page open in a second tab (dashboard visible)
- [ ] Have the Portal page open in a third tab (in case Aaron asks to explore)
- [ ] Practice the 3-minute flow out loud 3 times
- [ ] Time yourself — if you go past 3:30, you're talking too much
- [ ] Prepare your bridge question (Option A, B, or C)
- [ ] Have the live URL ready to share: https://jhgruver.github.io/perpetuals-showcase/sites/index.html

## SEND AFTER THE INTERVIEW

Within 2 hours, send Aaron a short email:

> Subject: Great talking today — here's the research
>
> Aaron,
>
> Really enjoyed our conversation about [specific thing discussed].
>
> Here's the full showcase if you want to dig deeper: [link]
>
> The competitive analysis and product vision are the most relevant to what we discussed. I'm especially curious about your take on [thing you discussed].
>
> Looking forward to next steps.
>
> Jacob

This turns your 3-minute teaser into extended consideration time. He'll explore on his own, at his pace, and be even more impressed because there's no one narrating over it.
